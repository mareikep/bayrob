About
=====

|project| is an fully operational system combining joint probability distributions to generate action models from a
robot's experience data. Probabilistic action models can be queried using the provided web application and action
sequences can be refined/generated by performing an A*-like backward or forward search and updating the robot's
probabilistic belief state according to the prospected results (or preconditions) of the respective steps.

If you are a developer, see :doc:`for_developers` for
examples how to execute learning and reasoning and :doc:`apidoc` for further documentation.

If you are a user, go to :doc:`for_users` to find out how to use the tools in |project|'s web interface.
