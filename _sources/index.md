# BayRoB

## About

#bayrob is a fully operational system combining joint probability distributions to generate action models from a
robot's experience data. Probabilistic action models can be queried using the provided web application and action
sequences can be refined/generated by performing an A\*-like backward or forward search and updating the robot's
probabilistic belief state according to the prospected results (or preconditions) of the respective steps.

If you are a developer, see [For Developers](dev/intro) for
examples how to execute learning and reasoning and the API for further documentation.

If you are a user, go to [For Users](user/intro) to find out how to use the tools in the project's web interface.
