## Usage

### Reasoning

BayRoB reasoning can be executed by defining a query...


Clicking the `Query`-button will trigger the reasoning process.

![Web interface: Query](img/webinterface_query.png "BayRoB Query")\
*The BayRoB Query window*

The results of the reasoning process will be shown in two ways. The first one is a visualization ...
(see :num:`Fig. #webif-hyps`: :ref:`webif-hyps`). The distributions plots can be downloaded as ``.svg`` files.

![Web interface: Query Results](img/webinterface_query.png "BayRoB Query Results")\
*The visualization of the query results allows to compare the ground truth with the computed (posterior) distributions.*
