# About

|project| is an fully operational system combining joint probability distributions to generate action models from a
robot's experience data. Probabilistic action models can be queried using the provided web application and action
sequences can be refined/generated by performing an A*-like backward or forward search and updating the robot's
probabilistic belief state according to the prospected results (or preconditions) of the respective steps.

If you are a developer, see [For Developers](for_developers.md) for
examples how to execute learning and reasoning and the API for further documentation.

If you are a user, go to [For Users](for_users.md) to find out how to use the tools in the project's web interface.

## Citing

When you publish research work that makes use of this software, we gratefully appreciate if a reference to BayRoB
can be found in your work in the following way:

```bibtex
@software{picklumbayrob,
    author  = {Picklum, Mareike},
    title   = {BayRoB},
    url     = {https://github.com/mareikep/bayrob},
    version = {1.0.0},
}
```

The PhD thesis {cite}`picklum2024phd` gives further insight about the capabilities of this software. For citations, the following Bibtex entry can be used for documents based on LaTeX:

```bibtex
